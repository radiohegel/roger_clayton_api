# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)

Project.create(title: "Awaken", description: "Awaken is a smart alarm clock system, in which a Raspberry Pi controlling a smart TV as a display maintains a connection with a web app built in Rails. Users can log into the web app to register their Awaken device, and then program alarms, selecting relevant information they wish to be provided to them at the time of the alarm. The information options include things like commuting time (allowing multiple means of transportation), weather, and current news. This project was completed by a team of five developers. My personal contributions were focused primarily on architecting and coding the device registration process, and the system for making API calls to consolidate data to be presented on the alarm display. The device registration design was particularly fun for me. I outfitted the Raspberry Pi with a simply python boot script, that would take the device's hardware ID and pass it along in a request to the Rails server. On the server side, the hardware ID gets checked against a database of registered devices. If a match is found, the server opens a publish/subscribe channel with the Pi, linked to the associated user, and sends a command to the Pi to turn on the smart TV and display a success screen. If the device ID is not found in the database, the server command instead prompts the Pi to load a registration instruction screen.")
